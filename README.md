## Project Description

This project, **Smart Wildlife Security: Fog-Powered Video Compression for Cloud Efficiency**, addresses the issue of wildlife incursions in rural areas by integrating cutting-edge technologies like fog computing and intelligent video compression. Key features include:

- **24/7 Surveillance**: Continuous video recording with selective transmission of relevant segments to the cloud.
- **Fog Computing**: Processes data closer to the source, minimizing latency and enhancing responsiveness.
- **Intelligent Compression**: Applies algorithms for smart frame extraction, reducing bandwidth usage and conserving resources.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates real-time PDF reports for monitoring wildlife activities and improving security measures.
- **Sustainability**: Promotes resource efficiency, aligning with environmentally friendly practices.

By optimizing data management and leveraging advanced technologies, this system aims to enhance human-wildlife coexistence and ensure rural safety. For more details, refer to the [full paper](./Smart_Wildlife_Security.pdf).
